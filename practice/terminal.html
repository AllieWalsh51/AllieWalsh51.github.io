	<h1>Terminal Tutorial!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the terminal tutorial, a spot for your basic terminal commands free of charge.<br> </p>
	<h2>Basic Commands</h2>
			<p>These commands are the basic commands you'll see in your life with the terminal.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>cd</dt>
			<dd>The command that moves you between directories:<kbd> cd place-to-move</kbd>.</dd>
			<dt>ls</dt>
			<dd>The command that shows you what's in a directory:<kbd> ls</kbd>.</dd>
			<dt>pwd</dt>

		<h2>More useful info</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>You use <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to terminate a process.</li>
			<li>Use the sudo command (not listed) with major caution. It can really break stuff if used wrong.</li>
			<li>Use cd .. to backtrack to the last file you were at and use cd ~ to get back to your home directory</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Vim!</h2>
		<p>Vim is a file editor within the terminal that I often use. To get into vim, simply type <kbd>vim file-name</kbd>. You move using the arrow keys, and in order to edit the file you must go into insert mode by pressing<kbd> i</kbd>. There are plenty of commands. Here's some html I wrote in vim. <pre>&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;</pre> <br> Guess what it will say. <br> <code> Hello, world! </code>
<p> Well that's it for this little tutorial. </p>
