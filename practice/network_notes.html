	<p>Vocab: Protocol, packet, header, payload, router, routing table. br> <br>
	There are a lot of problems, it's hard to tell where to send it if your map isn't accurate, sometimes packets just get dropped or messed up from hackers or transmission errors or other things, then it's hard to figure out the order to put the packets in.<br> 
	To fix these, we made a map by asking who our neighbors were and asking who their neighbors were, along with numbering our packets and giving them a send to and return address.</p>
