<h2>Why is it not working?</h2>

	<tr>
		<td>They're lumpy and didn't flatten out.</td>
		<td>The butter is likely not soft enough.</td>
		<td>Leave the butter out for longer.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>They flattened out too much.</td>
		<td>The butter is likely too soft.</td>
		<td>Make sure the butter is soft, but still holds it's shape.</td>
	</tr>

<p>Those are the main issues I encounter. The recipe as written takes 
	anywhere between 30-45 minutes, generally taking around 15 minutes to 
	prep. It makes roughly 36 servings.</p>
